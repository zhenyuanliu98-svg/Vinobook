## Troubleshooting

**Backend not starting:**
- Check Railway logs
- Verify DATABASE_URL is set (automatic)
- Check SECRET_KEY is set

**Frontend can't connect:**
- Check VITE_API_URL environment variable
- Verify ALLOWED_ORIGINS in backend includes your Vercel URL
- Check browser console for errors

**Database errors:**
- Railway provides PostgreSQL automatically
- Check "Database" tab in Railway for connection string

**Photo uploads not working:**
- Railway has ephemeral file system
- For production, consider AWS S3 (or upgrade Railway plan)
- For now, works great for testing

## Cost Estimates

**If you exceed free tiers:**
- Railway: ~$5-10/month for hobby project
- Vercel: Usually stays free
- Total: **$0-10/month** for unlimited users
